# Potato-Defect-Detection-System-Using-YOLOv8
This project is a real-time potato defect detection system using YOLOv8 and FastAPI. It processes base64 images, detects good and defective potatoes with separate models, tracks them using ByteTrack, maps defects by proximity, filters edge cases, calculates areas in mmÂ², and returns detailed results via a REST API.
